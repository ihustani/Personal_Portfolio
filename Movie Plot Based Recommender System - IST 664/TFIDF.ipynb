Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |[master, thief, max, burdett, (pierce, brosnan), and, his, beautiful, accomplice,, lola, cirillo, (salma, hayek),, steal, the, second, of, three, famous, diamonds,, known, as, the, napoleon, diamonds,, from, fbi, agent, stanley, p., lloyd, (woody, harrelson)., but, lloyd, shoots, max, before, passing, out, from, being, gassed, by, the, thieves., max, survives, and, tells, lola, to, get, the, diamond., she, does,, leaving, in, its, place, the, one-dollar, bill, that, she, had, received, as, a, tip, for, washing, the, agents', windshield, (while, in, disguise)., max, and, lola, then, fly, to, paradise, island, in, the, bahamas.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |(68756,[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,11,12,13,17,18,20,27,36,51,62,64,73,79,80,81,150,211,238,274,278,394,427,430,447,487,574,600,684,782,1000,1284,1299,1953,1991,2228,2330,2423,3739,6087,6644,6730,6976,7530,7617,7729,9852,10022,11310,11337,12244,13380,14629,17029,26940,26941,27705,34204,42574,54259,54851,56028,60885,61825],[7.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0])                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
